# WeatherDashboard

A weather dashboard to tell me today's weather and 5 day future forecast for a city that I search.

Used: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, OpenWeather Api's for weather data, moment js for date information. Weather symbol pulled in from openweather api.

Plans for future development:
Use some cool fonts with the google fonts api. Link the script.

Add a clear search list button to clear local storage and make buttons disappear. 

Pull in a picture of the city searched and display in the jumbotron with the weather. You could use a photo api to pull in and display the page. 

Persistent Data needs to be coded

on click for city name buttons needs to send the ajax search again to display the current weather for that city
